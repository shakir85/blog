Using Amazon CloudFront to serve S3 data can be more cost-effective than serving data directly from S3 in some situations. In this post, I will discuss key points to consider when deciding to use CloudFront for serving S3 content at the edge.

## Data transfer costs

 CloudFront can help reduce data transfer costs by caching and serving content from edge locations closer users. If your content is accessed *frequently* by users from different geographic locations, CloudFront can reduce the amount of data transferred over the internet compared to serving content directly from an S3 bucket.

## Latency and performance

CloudFront caches content at edge locations, which can significantly reduce latency and improve the overall performance for users. Users receive content from the nearest edge location, reducing the round-trip time to the original S3 bucket.

## Request patterns

CloudFront can help reduce the number of requests made directly to your S3 bucket by handling a portion of the requests at the edge locations. This can be beneficial if you have a high volume of requests for the same content.

## Edge location data processing: Lambda@Edge

CloudFront can also perform some data processing at the edge using [Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/). Lambda@Edge allows us to add a computing element when serving content at edge. For example, you can customize routing to S3 buckets, serve specific content when your website is in maintenance mode, and overall improved user experience without modifying your website code.

Overall, utilizing Lambda@Edge can reduce the load on your origin server (in this case, S3) and open the door for a lot of features that you can levrage.

## Consider these points too

With all the mentioed features of CloudFront for serving S3 content at edge, it's important to consider the following aspects as well:

### CloudFront cost

While CloudFront can help reduce data transfer costs, it introduces its own costs based on the number of requests and data transferred from edge locations. If your data access patterns do not benefit from caching, i.e. requests always need to hit the backedn S3 bucket, then the return on investment (ROI) of using CloudFront for S3 content might not be as cost-effective as expected, and you might incur unnecessary additional costs.

### Cache invalidation

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are ideal for serving static content. They are not typically a good option for dynamic content mainly due to their caching and latency handling characteristics. However, some CDN providers offer features to address these limitations such as routing optimization and cache invalidation.

If your data frequently changes and requires real-time updates (dynamic content), you may need to manage cache invalidation carefully with CloudFront, as it may introduce additional complexity and costs.

### Low volume data transfer

For very small data-transfers, or infrequent access patterns, the cost advantage of CloudFront + S3 might be less significant compared to fetching the data from S3 directly.

### Transfer to origin

Always consult AWS documentation and pricing calculator for details and up-to-date information regarding data transfer costs from Amazon CloudFront to S3 buckets, both within the same region and across regions. AWS pricing can vary depending on various factors, and staying informed about the current pricing structure is important to manage your AWS bill.

### Consider S3 Corss-Region Replication

If your application does not benefit from caching but you still want to keep the S3 data close to your users (for READ only ops), then consider using S3 Corss-Region Replication instead of CloudFront.
